### Install

2. Place `draw-custom-shape.jsx` in the Photoshop Scripts folder.
	- OS X: `/Applications/[Photoshop]/Presets/Scripts/`
	- Windows: `C:\[Program Files]\Adobe\[Photoshop]\Presets\Scripts`
4. Restart Photoshop. The script should now be available in `File ? Scripts ? draw-custom-shape`.

### Usage
Save Photoshop file into multiple sizes in one click.

Add point paths in the Main() function to the points array by adding a new PathPoint with the parameters (anchor(x,y), leftdirection(x,y), rightdirection(x,y).

For example:
new ShapePoint([200,100], [200,100], [200,100]); will create a point at position X:200 Y:100 with no curve anchor.
new ShapePoint([150,50], [100,50], [200,50]); will create a point at position X:150 Y:50 with equal curving to its left and right anchors.
