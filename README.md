### Usage
Draw a custom shape using code!

Add point paths in the Main() function to the points array by adding a new PathPoint with the parameters (anchor(x,y), leftdirection(x,y), rightdirection(x,y).

#### For example:

new ShapePoint([200,100], [200,100], [200,100]); *will create a point at position X:200 Y:100 with no curve anchor*.

new ShapePoint([150,50], [100,50], [200,50]); *will create a point at position X:150 Y:50 with equal curving to its left and right anchors.*
